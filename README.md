# A test assignment (ungraded)

Create a hello world program in Picat. In particular, executing
```
picat hello-world.pi
```
should output `Hello, World!`.

Push to your Github classroom repository and see if it passes the test. You can check a solution in the folder `solution/`. Tested with Picat 3.2#8, Linux (64-bit).
